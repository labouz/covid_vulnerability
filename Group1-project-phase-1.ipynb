    "Because of the wide reach of the impact of COVID-19 and its effect at all levels - individuals, commmunity, political, global, we anticipate that our analysis would be of interest to multiple parties. These include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Public health officials** - our analysis would be helpful for public health officials in identifying where the most robust response and public service announcements about disease control and mitigation needs to be directed. It can also guide them in making recommendations to policy makers on what control measures or restrictions need to be implemented.  Hospital visits and hospitalization rates due to a particular condition can be a good proxy for the health status of the local community and these insights can help to guide current and future efforts at any emerging or persistent hotspots of disease activity.\n",
    "* **Policy makers** - this analysis would be helpful as supportive evidence for policy makers in making decisions around disease transmission control measures such as mask mandates, shelter-in-place directions, elective procedure holds, and more.\n",
    "* **Dispartiy researchers** - because of our planned focus on the disparate impact of the pandemic on different communities, disparity researchers may find this analysis a helpful resource adding to the existing body of work to make a case for directing resources to the underserved and disproportionally affected communities. \n",
    "* **Hospital management** - one of the challenges in the pandemic has been keeping hospitals and other healthcare facilities from becoming overburdened and unable to provide care for all patients. This analysis may be helpful for hospital management in different facilities for helping with capacity management, planning for staffing, knowing what areas near them they may be able to transfer patients if needed, or when to request staffing help (for example from the National Guard, as we have seen happen during the peaks of the pandemic).\n",
    "* **The general public** - because hospitalizations related to a particular condition are usually a good indicator of the level of disease spread in that community, this analysis can be disseminated in a continously updated medium such as a public facing dashboard to help the general public in assessing and mitigating their disease exposure risk as they move about their own community or as they make travel plans.\n",

Additionally, it is useful to know the most efficient allocations of resources, and analysis of these datasets could help county officials make important decisions regarding fund allocations.  In a larger context, it could also help states direct the most efficient assistance of the national guard.  \n"
    "$\;\;\;\;\;\;$Further, analysis of these data can help the healthcare sector directly by providing insight into the most impactful distribution of medical equipment, such as ventilators, or in the manufacturing of said equipment by providing up-to-date information on what is required.  Our data also include information on pediatric care and the particular challenges presented therein.  It may be possible to compare our datasets in order to illuminate healthcare disparities, especially among vulnerable communities where children could have a higher risk of infection."

    "Since our analysis will be able to identify states and more specifically counties within states which have been hit particulary hard by COVID-19, analysis could be further continued at the county-level. Although our initial analysis may not necessarily explore data on individual county characteristics, it would likely be valuable to conduct additional analyses on a county level after identifiying certain COVID hot spots around the country to determine shared characteristics around the country. In particular, some additional demographic data that may be worth examining at the county level includes race distribution, age distribution, median household/individual income, and average household size. This additional data would be useful to pair with our analysis because it would be helpful to look at data for hot spot counties to identify potential confounding variables. Once pinpointed, analysis could also be done to explain the role played by these confounding variables regarding higher hospitalization rates. "

    "The data analysis and visualizations implemented in this project can be included in the form of reports and dashboards. Dashboards could be implemented via syncrhonized mode, where the data from an API is syncrhonized on a regular basis. This synchronization would be dependent on the frequency of updates from healthdata.gov. The stakeholders can gain insights and plan for surges or unique situations, dependent on the patterns and relationships found in our future analysis. The plan for dissesmination can vary based on the audiences domain, i.e. a disparity researcher will seek out different variables perhaps with a historical perspective on their dashboard (aggregation since March 2020), whereas hospital management will want to see analysis of features closer to real time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to accessing relevant reports with useful timeframes via reports/dashboards, the analysis can be published in papers such as the CDC Journal-subject to peer review, or presented at conferences such as Health Datapalooza and the International Conference on Big Data Analytics in Healthcare."
