# Anticipating COVID-19 Related Hospital Burden and Observing the Relationship to Burdened Communities

## March 14, 2022

This work employs several computational data science techniques including, but not limited to, data aquisition, manipulation, transformation, visualization, statistical inference and communication, to answer questions like:

  * the impact COVID-19 has had on hospital capacity in different regions of the country over time
  * the community burden of the COVID-19 pandemic
  * health disparities in the COVID-19 impact across different regions of the country

## About the data

Data for this research are publically available. They are non-identifiable and contain no protected health information. 

- [COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh)  

- [COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Crosswalk - Rank Ordered by Score](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/covid-19-community-vulnerability-crosswalk-rank-ordered-by-score)

## Files  

- Phase 1 - Proposal: `Group1-project-phase-1.ipynb`
- Because of the amount of code used in our analysis and to generate visualizations for our work, we have divided our submission across two main notebooks and several other supplemental files. 

1. `project.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the main written report with our motivating questions, description of the data, methods, results, and conclusions.  
2. `project_code.ipynb` -  Jupyter notebook containing all the code for our study.  Running this notebook should reproduce all our results

3. `/data` - this folder holds all the datasets used and referenced in our analysis.

4. `/images` - folder containing all the images produced and/or embedded in the report.

5. `/misc` - contains other supplemental information including a data dictionary describing the variables selected for our final analysis.
