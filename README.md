# Understanding the Intersectionality of COVID-19 Hospitalizations and Community Vulnerability

## March 18, 2022

This work employs several computational data science techniques including, but not limited to, data aquisition, manipulation, transformation, visualization, statistical inference and communication, to answer questions like:

1. What does the distribution of vulnerability look like by state? 
2. What is the standardized rate of hospitalizations per state? 
3. Is there a correlation between hospitalization rate and vulenerability? 
4. Are certain facilities more vulnerable to higher hospitalizations?
5. MORE TBD ;)
